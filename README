SolidWorks STL Exporter
=======================
Macro code for intelligent export of SolidWorks parts and assemblies in the STL format (i.e. for use in dynamic simulations).

Requirements
-------------
* SolidWorks 2011 SP0-SP3
* Visual Studio 2008+ (Express Editions are fine)
* Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0+ 

Usage
-----
Simply open up SolidWorks and start a new macro project (C#). Click on the 'Edit Macro' button in the toolbar and it will launch the blank template project in Visual Studio. Delete the pre-existing *.cs files and add the code files committed in the master branch. Compile with Visual Studio and you can even attach the debugger to the code if something doesn't work
